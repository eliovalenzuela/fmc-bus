# The IPMI-FRU material is in the "IPMI-FRU" file. It has been

# we have a "name" file, that includes "fdelay". But no configuration is
# needed.

# We also have a "calibration" file, that new fdelay drivers look for in the
# sdb structures. So there is no configuration for this item in here.


# What follows is no longer current, but I keep it for explanatory
# purposes.  This is something you can use if your driver doesn't rely
# on SDB to find the data but you still want to use it to generate the
# data.
#
# Older fdelay drivers wanted configuration at offset 0x1800, because
# SDB was not supported, and initially a known address was
# used. So prepare a writable file in there. The driver looks for "fd-c".
# The size of calibration information is around 100 bytes.
