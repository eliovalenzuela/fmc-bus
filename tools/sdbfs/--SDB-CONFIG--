# The contents reflect what I used to program my specimen of the
# "fine delay" card (official name: FmcDelay1ns4cha).

# SDB records live at offset 256 (the bus looks there and at other
# powers of two, but our FRU file is known to be small)

# The IPMI-FRU material is in the "IPMI-FRU" file. It has been
# generated using ../fru-generator like this:

# ../fru-generator -v CERN -n FmcDelay1ns4cha -s proto-0 \
#   -p EDA-02267-V3 > IPMI-FRU

# we have a "name" file, that includes "fdelay". But no configuration is
# needed.

# Finally, the fine-delay wants configuration at offset 0x1800, because
# SDB was added to the drivers later, and initially a known address was
# used. So prepare a writable file in there. The driver looks for "fd-c".
# The size of calibration information is around 100 bytes.
